    "**Autogen Library Onboarding & Book Recommendation System**\n",
    "\n",
    "This showcases an interactive system designed to onboard users and recommend books based on their preferences. It utilizes the Autogen framework to create multiple agents that collaborate to gather user information, recommend books, and execute necessary tasks such as file handling. Below is a brief overview of the key components and topics involved in the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "Conversable Agents:\n",
    " \n",
    "Login Agent: This agent helps onboard users by gathering basic information like their name and ID. The interaction is simple, and the agent terminates once the information is collected.\n",
    "Interest Agent: After the login information is gathered, this agent asks users for their reading preferences, such as preferred genres.\n",
    "Books Recommender Agent: Based on the user's genre preference, this agent recommends a list of books that align with their interest.\n",
    "Customer Proxy Agent: This acts as a middleman between the user and the other agents, facilitating communication and information exchange.\n",
    "Interaction Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Execution Agents:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Executor Agent: This agent is responsible for executing commands such as file creation and data storage. It uses a LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor to run necessary scripts and handle data processing tasks.\n",
    "Code Writer Agent: Once the user information is gathered, the code writer agent ensures that the data is appended to a library.csv file, creating the file if it doesnâ€™t already exist. This ensures that all user data is saved for future reference and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools/Framework used**\n",
    "- Autogen ConversableAgent \n",
    "- Autogen AssistantAgent\n",
    "- AzureOpenAi model used in backend\n",
    "- LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor\n"
